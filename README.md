## High-level Description
This application aims to simulate a relational database system that records all the relevant data for the NBA, similar to Basketball Reference. Being a professional sports league with the third largest annual revenue in the world of 8.8 billion dollars, there is a plethora of data captured on and off the court of the NBA.

## Data
We acquire most of our data through the NBA official site and Basketball Reference. Since most data on the sites listed can be transformed into a CSV file, we can easily import them into the database.
User Interaction: through our database application, users can look up essential statistics regarding each player, each game, and their corresponding arena and basketball team. Users can also explore players’ news outside the court and the teams’ sponsors, as well as checking other relevant data through the use of custom input.
